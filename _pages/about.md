Machine Learning Engineer | Generative AI Efficiency | Model Compression  



**Generative AI Efficiency (Qualcomm AI Research)**: My current work focuses on creating efficient solutions for Large and Small Language Models (LLMs/SLMs), multimodal foundation models, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) and other advanced LLM inference techniques like speculative decoding, accelerating on-device training.

**Model Compression (Huawei Noah's Ark Lab)**: At Noah's Ark Lab, Montreal, my work entailed developing and implementing neural network model compression techniques to improve computational performance (quantization, pruning, NAS across conv and transformer based architectures).

**Academic Research (McGill University)**: I obtained a thesis-based Master of Science in Machine Learning, where my research was advised by Prof. Mathieu Blanchette, focussing on applying Reinforcement Learning techniques in Bioinformatics.

**Software Development (Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, India)**: I began my career as a Software Developer, building a strong foundation in software engineering principles and practices after completing my bachelor's degree in India.
